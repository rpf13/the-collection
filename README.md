# The Collection
The Collection is a site, which allows a registered user to create and easily manage collections of his beloved items.

The application satisfies the demand for a simple solution, to easily inventory individual things in a beautifully designed cataloge. This can be, for example, a collection of weapons, a collection of model cars or very practical things, such as spare parts for motorcycles. Everything is possible!

A Collection consists of multiple individual items, where each item can be described and images can be uploaded to make the catalog more appealing.
A search function gives the user the possibility to find the item of his desire inside a collection.

## UX & Design

The overall design has been kept very simple, kind of industrial design and raw. The main focus should be the content, which is the uploaded image and the description. Everything else should be in the background. Therefore the whole colore scheme is dark, to give the focus to the content - either via the cards containing collections or the item list. The background of the descriptive description inside the card is intentionally white, in order to have immediate focus.

The design is minimalistic, the navigation very intuitive. The background animation is subtile, it does not distract but gives a nice colorful effect, evne though it is kept dark. The main heading of the entry site is an eye catcher, with its transparent text and the moving, dark colored clouds behind it.

---

### Color Scheme

There are different color sets used in this project. Furthermore, the Bootstrap included colors / color classes have been used. I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to pick and compare the various colors.
I have spent quite some efforts to make sure, all colors and color combinations pass the contrast test, making sure the accessibility is given.
The main font color palete contains the following colors: #F5F5F5 is used as text color, in addition the Bootstrap "text-light" (#F8F9FA). The #C0C0C0 has been used as a replacement for the standard "blue" active link color, in order to give a better contrast on the background. The #343A40 is the standard Bootstrap black. The red, blue and purple colors have been used to highlight the social media fonts, when hovering.

The navbar colors are Bootstrap colors, with the exception of the #3B0707, which has been used as the active link color. Unfortunately the Bootstrap included / default color for this kind of navbar, does not pass the contrast test.

The main color-highlight is the animated, gradient background. It contains two base colors and then varies in betweend them.

### Data Model

The following ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) displays the SQL database schema and the associated models, used to create this project. It shows the underlaying fundament of the individual models and their relation to it.
Django AllAuth is used to create a user authentication system.

## Features

### Features Left to Implement

- I had to step back from the idea of having multiple images per item, since this has increased the level of complexity for the whole project quite a lot. Since I have to deliver MVP, I will let this feature for future implementation. I had to adapt the db model to reflect this.

### Commit messages

I have decided to mostly use multiline commit messages. Commit messages are an essential part of the whole project and a single line commit message is just not enough to explain. After reading [this interesting article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/), it was clear to me, that I have to use it.

I have decided to use (mostly) multiline commits, but using tags as described this [cheatsheet](https://cheatography.com/albelop/cheat-sheets/conventional-commits/) or as also described in the LMS of the Code Institute. I did use the following syntax guidline:
- **feat:** for feature which may or may not include a CSS part
- **fix:** for a bugfix
- **style:** for changes to CSS or to give style to the code itself
- **docs:** for changes related to documentation
- **refactor:** for refactored code, re-written code
- **maint:** for general maintenance

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects
[Github Projects](https://github.com/users/rpf13/projects/3) has been used as the Agile tool during the development phase of this project. The Kanban board was very useful to keep track on the tasks. I have created 4 columns (Epics, ToDo, In Progress, On Hold, Done) and moved the stories accordingly. The Epics column has been very helpful to see all main objectives. The On Hold column has served as a "parking spaces", when a story was partially done, but not completely finished.

![Github Projects Kanban Board](docs/images/github_projects.png)

### GitHub Issues
[Github Issues](https://github.com/rpf13/the-collection/issues) has been used to create all the stories, before they were placed on the projects Kanban board. I have create two templates, one for Epics and one for Stories.
Each Epic and all the related stories have an epic label, which makes it very easy to filter for all tasks, related to one epic. Simply click on the label, while being in the Kanban board. Epics do also have a dedicated label called Epic, which makes it easy to filter all epics.
Once a story has been created via the template, it will be automatically added to the Kanban board in the Todo column.

![Github Issues](docs/images/github_issues.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization
The MoSCoW prioritization has been used to divide all epics and stories into the following categories:

- **MustHave:** guaranteed to be delivered
- **ShouldHave:** adds significant value, but not mandatory for MVP
- **CouldHave:** adds value, would be nice to have
- **WontHave:** no priority for this iteration, acts as placeholder for future implementation

A related Github label has been created for each category and added to each epic, story - which makes it easy to identify and see the value it brings.
