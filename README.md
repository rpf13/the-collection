### Commit messages

I have decided to mostly use multiline commit messages. Commit messages are an essential part of the whole project and a single line commit message is just not enough to explain. After reading [this interesting article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/), it was clear to me, that I have to use it.

I have decided to use (mostly) multiline commits, but using tags as described this [cheatsheet](https://cheatography.com/albelop/cheat-sheets/conventional-commits/) or as also described in the LMS of the Code Institute. I did use the following syntax guidline:
- **feat:** for feature which may or may not include a CSS part
- **fix:** for a bugfix
- **style:** for changes to CSS or to give style to the code itself
- **docs:** for changes related to documentation
- **refactor:** for refactored code, re-written code
- **maint:** for general maintenance
