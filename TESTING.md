## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

As my project uses Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}`
it will not validate properly if I copy and paste into the HTML validator straight from my source files.

Usually in order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, nearly all of the pages on this site require a user to be logged-in and authenticated,
and will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to the pages.

In order to properly validate my HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, I followed these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

In the following table, all W3C testing is presented with snapshots.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS files.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files / content. I do have only a very small piece of JS code embedded in my base.html template.
This JS code is a simple client side verification, which limits the user to upload only images, the image picker will only show images. I do understand that this is a very simple, client side only verification and that it could be improved via server side verification. This advanced check is added to the "Features left to implement" section.
Neverthless, I did check it with jshint and did not find an error:

### Python

I have used the recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.
I have tested it on Chrome and Safari on OSX and Edge in Windows 10.
Please note that in addition to these desktop tests, there are also tests done in the responsiveness section with Chrome on iOS and Firefox on iPadOS.

In the table below you can find snapshots of each browser. I did a "walkthrough" of the most important features / workflow, which a user would execute.

## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.
I have used real devices for testing:
- MacBook Pro M1 with OS X 13.2.1
- iPhone12 Pro with iOS 16.4.1
- iPad Pro 11" with iPadOS 16.4.1

In the table below you can find snapshots of each browser / plattform. I did a "walkthrough" of the most important features / workflow, which a user would execute.

## User Story Testing

I have tested the functional user stories and listed in the following table, together with a screenshot. Since I did also add user stories for admin tasks like mentor sessions, documentation, app submission, I did not include them in the table - since snapshots are difficult for those. However, they are also clearly documented in the README section.

<details>

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I have tested the "Collection" app via unit test [Collection App Unit Testing](collection/tests.py). I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test collection.tests`

All testcases are successfully executed:

![Unit Test Collection App](docs/testing/unit_test_summary.png)

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands after first installing the coverage package via pip:

`pip3 install coverage`

`coverage run --source=collection manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

I did then open the webbrowser via the local server port and did navigate to the htmlcov folder.

Below are the results from the "Collection" app on my application that I've tested:

![Unit Test Coverage Report](docs/testing/unit_test_coverage_report.png)

The following table shows a summary of testcases executed:

| Class | Function | Description | Comment |

## Bugs

### GitHub **Issues**

I did use GitHub Issues to track all my work, as already explained in the Agile Development section of the README. Below a snapshot with an excerpt:
![Github Issues](docs/testing/github_issues.png)
I have tracked my bugs via a `bug` label in github issues, opened them as stories and added them to the kanban board.
Since I did start from the beginning to deploy my project to Heroku, I did continuously verify the state of the application. Furthermore, each feature was locally tested, before / just after commit. Therefore I could fix most of the issues during the development phase. I did not open bugs when discovering an issue while being still on the development face of that particular feature.

**Fixed Bugs**

| Bug | Status |
| --- | --- |
| [Item create text form not responsive on mobile](https://github.com/rpf13/the-collection/issues/54) | Closed |

**Open Issues**

When writing / submitting my project for assessment, there were no open issues, bugs I am aware of. However, the epic with the stretch items / future features is still in the open state. Such epics, stories got the `WontHave` tag during MoSCoW priorisation. 
Any remaining open issues can be tracked [here](https://github.com/rpf13/the-collection/issues).
For the `WontHave` Epic and their potential user stories, the following snapshot shows the current state. This is basically the only Epic left open, after submitting this project.
![Github Stretch Epic](docs/testing/github_stretch_epic.png)

## Unfixed Bugs

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
